Design Challenge Problems

My problem is to address the lack of local sports focused networks in Chicago. Most radio stations only cover broad world topics. Contraints- Chicago is a big market to cover and its hard to cover topics while being in college I'm going to develop a local sports and pop-culture radio station for the Chicago community I want to shake up the Chicago market and change the podcast people in the Chicago community consume. I want to take all the viewers ESPN and Fox Sports has to my network.
